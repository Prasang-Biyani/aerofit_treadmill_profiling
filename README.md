# Aerofit
[Aerofit](https://aerofit.co/) is a leading brand in the field of fitness equipment. Aerofit provides a product range including machines such as treadmills, exercise bikes, gym equipment, and fitness accessories to cater to the needs of all categories of people.

# Business problem
The market research team at AeroFit wants to identify the characteristics of the target audience for each type of treadmill offered by the company, to provide a better recommendation of the treadmills to the new customers. The team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product with respect to customer characteristics.

# High level solution
Perform descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each AeroFit treadmill product by developing appropriate tables and charts. For each AeroFit treadmill product, construct two-way contingency tables and compute all conditional and marginal probabilities along with their insights/impact on the business.

EDA Approach
1. Case Study started with fundamental analysis like describing and printing the shape of the dataset, value_counts, descriptive statistics, etc. 
2. After every analysis, observations are written for every operation.
3. Used heatmap (correlation) to find the linear relationship between numerical values (age, income, miles, etc.). Also, use pairplots to find relationships among features using graphs.
4. Using Univariate & Bivariate analysis to visualize the effect of one variable on another variable using graphs (countplot, kdeplot, etc.).
5. Multivariate analysis is also used to find patterns against gender, marital status and the bought product.
6. Two-way contingency tables are used to find the conditional, joint, and marginal probability among gender, product and fitness.
7. Different customer profiles are created based on three different products based on the above analysis.
8. Finally, recommended ways to increase sales of treadmill models.
